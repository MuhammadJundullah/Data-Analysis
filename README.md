# About

This repository contains a collection of data analysis notebooks created for my portfolio. The notebooks cover a range of data analysis tasks, including data exploration, visualization, and the application of statistical and machine learning models. Each notebook is accompanied by a step-by-step explanation of the methodology used, analysis results, and data visualizations. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills in data analysis and my ability to present findings in a clear and informative manner.
